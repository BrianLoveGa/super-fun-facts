      <h3>This is the 49ers' seventh Super Bowl appearance.</h3>
      <h3>
        San Francisco went to five Super Bowls between 1981-1994 and won all
        five of them.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        49ers coach Kyle Shanahan will be making his Super Bowl debut,
        solidifying the first father-son duo to make separate Super Bowl
        appearances in NFL history. Shanahan's dad, Mike, was the Niners'
        offensive coordinator during their 1994 championship, then led the
        Denver Broncos to back-to-back titles in 1997-1998.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        The 49ers are just the third team in NFL history to reach the Super Bowl
        after winning four or fewer games the season before.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo has two Super Bowl rings from his time
        as Tom Brady's backup with the New England Patriots. He'll be looking
        for his first "real" trophy against the Chiefs.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        At 13-3 in 2019, San Francisco not only had the best record in the NFC
        but its first winning season since 2013.

      <h3>
        This is the first Super Bowl appearance for the Chiefs in 50 years.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        On Jan. 11, 1970, the Chiefs topped the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl
        IV for their first and only win so far.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Chiefs coach Andy Reid will be just the 24th head coach in NFL history
        to appear in more than one Super Bowl.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Since returning from a knee injury that sidelined him for two games in
        the fall, Mahomes (chiefs QB) has thrown 19 touchdowns and just four
        interceptions, including the playoffs.
